The main priority for the CLARKE framework is to better standardize our working structure, and add enhancements in support of design changes and usability efforts. CLARKE will make attempts to better apply design and functional patterns in easy-to-replicate methods. Performance and accessibility are core elements, which by association will improve SEO efforts.

CLARKE is named for Edith Clarke (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Clarke).

There is no demand for women engineers, as such, as there are for women doctors; but there's always a demand for anyone who can do a good piece of work.
